# Nazi Zombies: Portable (NZ:P)

Nazi Zombies: Portable is a project that allows you to play Call of Duty: Zombies on a LOT of devices/platforms, from Windows to Linux to Browser to Nintendo Switch to PSP to PlayStation VITA (you get the idea).
It is based on the FTEQW engine and this egg can be used as a plain FTEQW egg if you desire.

## Port
27500 TCP (for WS connection for Web Clients), 27500 UDP (for Native Clients) - Port for both TCP and UDP can be changed by modifying `sv_port_tcp` and `sv_port` variables respectively.
